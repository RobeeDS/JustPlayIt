            <div class="ana">
              <img src="img/ana.png">
              <h4> Ana</h4>
              <p>Ana’s versatile arsenal allows her to affect heroes all over the battlefield. Her Biotic Rifle rounds and Biotic Grenades heal allies and damage or impair enemies; her sidearm tranquilizes key targets, and Nano Boost gives one of her comrades a considerable increase in power. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="ashe">
              <img src="img/ashe.png">
              <h4> Ashe </h4>
              <p>Ashe quickly fires her rifle from the hip or uses her weapon’s aim-down sights to line up a high damage shot. She blasts enemies by throwing dynamite, and her coach gun packs enough punch to put some distance between her and her foes. And Ashe is not alone, as she can call on her omnic ally Bob, to join the fray when the need arises. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="Bap">
              <img src="img/baptiste.png">
            	<h4>Baptiste</h4>
              <p>Baptiste wields an assortment of experimental devices and weaponry to keep allies alive and eliminate threats under fierce conditions. A battle-hardened combat medic, he is just as capable of saving lives as he is taking out the enemy. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

              <h4> Bastion </h4>
              <p>Repair protocols and the ability to transform between stationary Assault, mobile Recon and devastating Tank configurations provide Bastion with a high probability of victory. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="brig">
              <img src="img/brig.png">
              <h4> Brigitte </h4>
              <p>Brigitte specializes in armor. She can throw Repair Packs to heal teammates, or automatically heal nearby allies when she damages foes with her Flail. Her Flail is capable of a wide swing to strike multiple targets, or a Whip Shot that stuns an enemy at range. When entering the fray, Barrier Shield provides personal defense while she attacks enemies with Shield Bash. Brigitte’s ultimate ability, Rally, gives her a substantial short-term boost of speed and provides long-lasting armor to all her nearby allies. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="Dva">
              <img src="img/d.va.png">
              <h4> D.Va </h4>
              <p>D.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful—its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or deflect attacks with her projectile-dismantling Defense Matrix. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="Doomfist">
              <img src="img/doomfist.png" >
              <h4> Doomfist </h4>
              <p> Doomfist’s cybernetics make him a highly-mobile, powerful frontline fighter. In addition to dealing ranged damage with his Hand Cannon, Doomfist can slam the ground, knock enemies into the air and off balance, or charge into the fray with his Rocket Punch. When facing a tightly packed group, Doomfist leaps out of view, then crashes down to earth with a spectacular Meteor Strike.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="echo">
              <img src="img/echo.png" >

              <img src="img/gengi.png" >
              <h4> Genji </h4>
              <p>Genji flings precise and deadly Shuriken at his targets, and uses his technologically-advanced katana to deflect projectiles or deliver a Swift Strike that cuts down enemies. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="Hanzo">
               <img src="img/hanzo.png" >
               <h4> Hanzo</h4>
               <p>Hanzo’s versatile arrows can reveal his enemies or fragment to strike multiple targets. He can scale walls to fire his bow from on high, or summon a titanic spirit dragon. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="junk">
              <img src="img/junk.png" >
              <h4> Junkrat </h4>
              <p> Junkrat’s area-denying armaments include a Frag Launcher that lobs bouncing grenades, Concussion Mines that send enemies flying, and Steel Traps that stop foes dead in their tracks.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="beat">
              <img src="img/lucio.png" >
              <h4> Lucio</h4>
              <p>On the battlefield, Lúcio’s cutting-edge Sonic Amplifier buffets enemies with projectiles and knocks foes back with blasts of sound. His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="cree">
              <img src="img/mcree.png" >
              <h4> McCree </h4>
                <p>Armed with his Peacekeeper revolver, McCree takes out targets with deadeye precision and dives out of danger with eagle-like speed. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="demon">
               <img src="img/mei.png" >
               <h4> Mei</h4>
               <p> Mei’s weather-altering devices slow opponents and protect locations. Her Endothermic Blaster unleashes damaging icicles and frost streams, and she can Cryo-Freeze herself to guard against counterattacks, or obstruct the opposing team's movements with an Ice Wall.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

               <img src="img/mercy.png">
               <h4> Mercy </h4>
               <p> Mercy’s Valkyrie Suit helps keep her close to teammates like a guardian angel; healing, resurrecting or strengthening them with the beams emanating from her Caduceus Staff.</p>
             </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="moira">
              <img src="img/moria.png" >
              <h4>Moira </h4>
              <p>Moira’s biotic abilities enable her to contribute healing or damage in any crisis. While Biotic Grasp gives Moira short-range options, her Biotic Orbs contribute longer-range, hands-off damage and healing; she can also Fade to escape groups or remain close to allies in need of support. Once she’s charged Coalescence, Moira can save multiple allies from elimination at once or finish off weakened enemies. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

               <h4> Orisa </h4>
               <p>Orisa serves as the central anchor of her team, and defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She can attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once. </p>
             </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

             <h4> Pharah </h4>
             <p>Soaring through the air in her combat armor, and armed with a launcher that lays down high-explosive rockets, Pharah is a force to be reckoned with. </p>

              <h4> Roadhog </h4>
              <p>Roadhog uses his signature Chain Hook to pull his enemies close before shredding them with blasts from his Scrap Gun. He’s hardy enough to withstand tremendous damage, and can recover his health with a short breather. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
