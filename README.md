Notice
-----
This repository is no longer under active development. JustPlay it is the first front-end web development project completed during the first semester of the Exploring Computer Science course at VHTPA. Codeveloped with @DVLS, Just Play It! is a website made to introduce visitors to games that we found fun at the time of development. Featuring the original Overwatch, Just Play It! gives insight to its in-game characters and roles.
