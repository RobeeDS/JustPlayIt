      <h1> Tips for progressing </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Bronze</li>
        <p>For Bronze, try to work on your experience with all the heroes Overwatch has to offer. Work on communication, and don't instantly lock in to the hero you wanna play. Learn your way around different maps and make sure you understand who and when to target a player. Don't switch characters thinking you're going to make a huge play. Stick to one character at a time, and see if it suits your team's composition.</p>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <p>For Silver, don't attempt to become a one-trick pony. Keep trying to understand mechanics and work on your map awareness. Don't forget to thoroughly communicate with your team. Avoid running off by yourself, and stick with your team. </p>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <p>For Gold, you're not trying to play the game for pride. Stick with your team and make sure you make the necessary call outs for not only yourself, but your teammates. Communication in this and higher ranks becomes a necessity. Be sure not to immediately tell and demand your teammates to play a certain character, as this shows how inflexible you are at the game. At this point you need to adapt to your team's and enemy team's playstyle. </p>
        <li>Platinum</li>
        <p>For Platinum, be sure to communicate who and where an enemy is. Learn your enemy's patterns, stack with good teammates, and really focus on working on yourself. This includes your aim, map awareness, and your character flexibility. Identify when and where to apply pressure to the enemy team.</p>
        <li>Diamond</li>
        <p>For Diamond, really spend time on improving your experience in a few characters from all three classes. Ensuring mastery in these characters will bring you a good reputation and trust from your teammates. Know when and where to be, as your presence can pose as an effective win or lose condition.</p>
        <li>Master</li>
        <p>For Master, learn from and study professional players. Play, play, and play. There isn't much to say. Master your characters, and hit almost, if not all your shots.</p>
        <li>GrandMaster</li>
        <p>At this point, you're playing casually. You've reach a skill level that 99% of players have not reached. Well done.</p>
    </ul>
