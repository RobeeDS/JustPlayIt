      <h1> Overwatch Lore </h1>
    <h3>In the world of Overwatch, humanity was graced with a golden age of technology, peace and exploration. On the exploration front, humans built the Horizon Lunar Colony. Their focus on the exploration of space, but also an active research facility. It was manned by a league of scientists and genetically engineered gorillas were there to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space.
      One of the biggest breakthroughs in the world was the development of omnics, robots with advanced artificial intelligence. Omnics were a leading force in bolstering global manufacturing efforts and key in creating economic equality around the world. The robots driven by these AIs became ubiquitous. The world built large facilities called omniums in every major cultural center to churn them out.
      Disaster came when the Horizon Lunar Base and its population of hyper intelligent gorillas revolted. The gorillas killed all the scientists on the base and all but one of the gorillas maintained their hostility. Around the same time, something happened to the world's omnium facilities, putting the world into crisis.</h3>
    <h3>Omniums created Bastion units specifically for combat and were the main force of the Omnic Crisis. All around the world, omnics that once helped us become a stable society turned and attacked mankind. To respond to this threat, the United Nations formed Overwatch, a task force of soldiers and scientists. Overwatch was highly praised by countries for their valorant efforts and successful outcomes. This was the start of Overwatch's Golden Age. After the Crisis, the organization evolved into a global peacekeeping force and an engine for innovation, making advances in scientific fields ranging from space exploration to medical research. Overwatch later was shut down by the United Nations after a series of scandals and the deaths of two of its leaders. Despite the threat of prosecution, there was an attempt to recall the organization in order to rectify and pacify the regrowing Omnic threats.</h3>
    <h3>However, Overwatch has not just one enemy. The primary opposing organization, known as Talon, conducts operations to make an attempt towards ultimate power. Talon is formed from ex-operatives of Overwatch, especially those who have become corrupt. With its leader, Doomfist, Talon seeks to sow turmoil across the globe to strengthen the human race. Repeatedly, Talon has demonstrated disregard for the standard rules of engagement, attacking both military and civilian targets with impunity.
Talon was operating as early as the years following the end of the Omnic Crisis. In the time since, they have steadily grown more bold and powerful. Members of Talon are clad in black body armor, complete with helmets and face-obscuring ballistic masks. However, these soldiers appear to be mere rank-and-file grunts; Talon commands enough technological and scientific talent to create and field far more lethal operatives, such as Widowmaker.
